# trmnl-spec

Integration tests for the TRMNL firmware: real builds (`../trmnl-firmware/.pio/build/<env>`)
run in the simulator (`../trmnl-sim`, `target/release/trmnl-sim`) against mock TRMNL servers,
checked with RSpec. README.md is the full reference (running, `ENVS`, what is covered,
environment variables, writing tests); the simulator itself (its control API, fault
injection, memcheck, coverage) is documented in ../trmnl-sim/README.md.

## Repository rules

- Local git only: never push, never add a remote.
- Commit after each coherent improvement. Commit messages: a subject line, a body saying
  why, and end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Run `rake check` (rubocop, and every spec loads for every device) before committing.
- Never run `pio` unless asked (`rake firmware` runs it); the user builds firmware. Never edit
  `../trmnl-firmware` from here (read it freely: `src/`, `lib/`, `.pio/libdeps/<env>/`, and the
  IDF/Arduino sources under `~/.platformio/packages` are the reference for what the hardware
  must do). Never run `pio run -c <other.ini>` in the firmware checkout: a different project
  config makes PlatformIO wipe every env's `.pio/build`.
- A simulator bug is fixed in ../trmnl-sim (with its own rules, see its CLAUDE.md), not
  worked around here.

## Running

- Plain RSpec: `bundle exec rspec [path[:line]] [-e ...]`, or `bundle exec parallel_rspec`
  (`rake spec` builds the simulator first, then runs it). `ENVS`
  (spec/support/selection.rb) lists the devices a run covers: PlatformIO environments or
  `core` / `byod` / `all`, each optionally `:full`. A listed device runs its own specs and
  the general `:smoke` examples; `:full` runs every general example on it. Default
  `trmnl:full TRMNL_X trmnl_4clr trmnl_gen2 trmnl_gen2_4clr`; unlisted devices and missing
  builds are left out (a new example without `:smoke` needs its device listed with `:full`).
  `TRMNL_SIM_SLOW=1`, `TRMNL_SPEC_NO_CACHE=1` as needed.
- While iterating, run ONE group or example at a time under a hard limit and clean up:
  `perl -e 'alarm 90; exec @ARGV' bundle exec rspec spec/general/setup/portal_spec.rb:42; pkill -f target/release/trmnl-sim`
  (`ENVS=<env>` or `ENVS=<env>:full` for one device). No full-suite runs for debugging; a
  full run is for a final regression check (run it in the background).
- Onboarded devices are cached in `tmp/spec-cache/` keyed by firmware, simulator and test
  support code, so the first run after a change is slower.

## Writing tests

- `spec/support/devices.rb` has a `Device` profile per environment (size, inks, chip,
  battery, button, core or BYOD, ...). Every group declares the environment it runs:
  `env: "<env>"` (device specs: spec/core/ for the TRMNL-branded devices, spec/byod/ for the
  rest), or `General.describe` for general specs (spec/general/), which is defined once per
  listed device and must adapt to its `Device` (`device` / `build` in the group; use
  `device_image`, `needs:` / `only_on:` metadata, `match_golden`). Metadata is documented in
  `spec/support/metadata.rb`; the client library (`TrmnlSim::Simulator`, `MockTrmnl`,
  `Images`, `Lcov`) is in `lib/trmnl_sim/`.
- A test that fails because the firmware is wrong stays in and is marked:
  `known_failure: { "<env>" => "what the firmware does wrong, file:line" }` on the example
  (or group), or `pending: "..."` with a comment. Verify the root cause in the firmware
  source first. Never weaken an assertion or work around a firmware bug.
- A test that fails because the simulator is wrong gets the simulator fixed in ../trmnl-sim:
  general, minimal changes that keep the other chips and boards behaving identically.
- Golden screenshots: per-device ones live in `golden/<env>/`. Look at every new or
  rewritten golden (open the PNG) before committing it; wrong-looking output is a firmware
  bug to record, not a golden.
- Style: rubocop (`.rubocop.yml`: double quotes, 120 columns). Match the surrounding code's
  comment density and naming; comments explain device behaviour and why, with firmware
  file:line references where relevant.

## Adding a board

After the board exists in the simulator (a `BoardSpec` row in ../trmnl-sim): add a `Device`
in `spec/support/devices.rb` and a board group in spec/byod/ using the BYOD support
(`spec/support/byod.rb`); then run `ENVS=<env>:full bundle exec parallel_rspec` and classify
every failure as above. Update the README's coverage notes.
