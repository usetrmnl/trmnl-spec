# Every run records firmware coverage: each simulator writes an lcov tracefile into this run's
# directory under tmp/coverage/, one subdirectory per build. When the run is over (all of
# parallel_rspec's processes), the firmware's own code is merged into out/cov/merged.info and
# out/cov/html/ (TrmnlSim::Lcov) and its coverage printed. Third-party code (the framework,
# .pio/libdeps, vendored drivers) is left out: the tests aren't meant to cover it.
#
# The setup flows run once and are cached (SetupCache): their tracefiles are kept in the cache
# entry and copied into every run that uses it, so a cached run reports the same lines.
